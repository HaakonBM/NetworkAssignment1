Client-server architecture
application layer: http/https, DNS
transport layer: TCP

how the app works: 
Client initiates communication with server via socket.
The socket contains ip of server and port.
The server listens for communication on a set port number and accepts the client socket.
Communication has been established. (TCP)
Now the user types in a URL, the client then sends the URL to the server.
Once received the server uses DNS and http/https to read the contens of the URL.
The server sorts through the contents and returns an appropriate response (emails on webpage, no emails found, bad URL)
to the client.
